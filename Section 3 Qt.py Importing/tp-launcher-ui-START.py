''' 
The goal of this tool is to create a GUI that 
allows the user to quickly create, select and 
delete workspaces and add, remove and launch
applications within those workspaces.

This tool is the beginning of a pipeline 
management application in which you could keep
multiple users using the same version of software,
copy distinct settings and files to the clients 
machines and a whole bunch of other cool stuff.
